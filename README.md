## Objective

> This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.   
> You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you canâ€™t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

## OS available

> You must choose as an operating system either the latest stable version of Debian (no testing/unstable), or the latest stable version of Rocky.   
> (Debian is highly recommended if you are new to system administration).
